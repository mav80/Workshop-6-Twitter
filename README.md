Workshop 6 - Twitter

The aim of this workshop is to write an app that has functionality similar to Twitter.

Without logging in, user can read tweets and comments wrote by registered users, and after registration - write own messages and comments (limited to 280 and 60 characters, respectively), which then can be edited/deleted within 2 hours since posting. User can also upload an avatar picture (up to 1MB in size) which will be show next to his/her tweets, and send private messages to other users.

Administrator can freely edit and delete users and their tweets/comments/messages. Random tweets and comments (for testing purposes) can also be created via admin panel.

App supports pagination, amount of tweets er page can also be set.
